# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
   Creates a hierarchical tree structure for all elements in a document.  I like the idea that all of the code is kind of corralled and organized.  I really like that a change one place can change all, however this may not always be desirable.  I also like the visual layout. 

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
    It seemed like there was a lot of JavaScript all over the place on wordpress.com. 

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
    I like the visual layout.  It feels like the information is very nicely accessible.  I like the connections and interactions.


* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
    It took a while to learn, but it seems fairly intuitive.  I enjoyed it. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
    I read Wikipedia and the Computer Desktop Encyclopedia to review and summarize my thoughts.
    I found Debugging JavaScript useful:             https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/javascript-debugging#liveedit
    I also used closure library:

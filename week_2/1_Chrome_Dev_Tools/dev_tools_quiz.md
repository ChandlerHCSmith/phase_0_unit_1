##QUIZ
* Explain which tabs support the following actions and how.
  * Realtime editing of HTML and CSS 
     Once in Tool Developer, the Elements tab and all the info on the Right-hand side is directly applicable.
  
  * Javascript Debugging
     I know that we can use Breakpoints and live editing which requires us to open Sources.  However, I don't feel strong in this area.
  
  * Performance Optimization 
     PageSpeed and the Network tab.  


* What's the quick key for your OS to spawn the Dev Tools inspector?
    Opt Command I is the shortest.
    The Triple Parallel Lines
    Ctrl Click for the MAC produces the Inspect Element 
   

* Go to http://www.postmachina.com/ and analyze and tweak this nicely designed page.
  * What is the current background color for the page?  (Surprisingly, it's not just black!)
     The current background color is: #0b0f11.
  * Tweak the background color to white.
     I tweaked it to white and then several other colors.
  * Tweak the height of the side bar that contains the logo.  Shrink it down to 85px.
     It is now 85px.
  * Roll over the navigation links.  When you hover over them, they dissapear.  Let's change the hover color to black instead.
     Done. 

  * Now take a screenshot of your new (and maybe not so improved) design.  It should match this screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/5ak1jkpl5/
      Very cool!

  * Upload your own image to the web using an image hosting service.  It should match the image above. The last nav link in the image above is black because the mouse was hovering there when the screenshot was taken. Do the same, and don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. (This is part of the challenge.)

* For the postmachina website, why can't you tweak the color of the text "The most important things are not things"?  Please explain.
    Because it is an image, not text.  The text that is very similar has been indented -9999px.

* Go to www.ticketswizard.com and analyze the page.  
  * What is the largest image on the website?
     sellyourtix_1.sflb.ashx, 841 kB

  * Explain how you would find out this information, and list the URL of offending image here and how big it is.
     Networks and Preview or Networks and size, click to order.

* Test the www.ticketswizard.com website with google's [PageSpeed Insights](http://www.ticketswizard.com/).  (You can also download the chrome plugin).  What is the lowest hanging fruit to optimize the website?  How many kilobytes of data can be eliminated?
    Optimize Images Optimize the following images to reduce their size by 207.7KiB (14% reduction). 
    Leverage Browser Caching.  I am not sure that this eliminates kilobytes or reduces "requests"

5) Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?

1)  My questions really centered on positioning the header, sidebar, content area, and footer.  I am finding that I do not have a complete understanding of how to decide positioning.  I know that there is a better solution than the one I utilized, because I have seen it months ago.  I had enough resources that I worked on it until I got it close.  I still want to improve in this area.

2)  Same answer as #1.

3)  I liked the top/bottom for adding a caption to an image.  I also enjoyed seeing 3 different ways to accomplish the same end result.  Source: http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/www/captions.html#float

4)  It varies from very confident on most to really needing some clarification on positioning.  Plus I need to go back and review %, px, and em's.  I understand that they are conversions and this part is quite easy for me, however I recall that they are useful in creating layouts that resize correctly between differnet viewing windows.

5)  I enjoy creating something visual.  I would like to have spent more time on colors, fonts, borders, and other effects.  It is really cool to create something that you see on the web everyday!

6)  Positioning.  I really believe that this is not that hard and all I need is my bearings once.  Looking forward to that moment!

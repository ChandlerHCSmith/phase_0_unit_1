## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

1) What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
2) What seems good and bad about HTML?
3) Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
4) Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1) HTML seems to make quite a bit of sense.  It has the same format every time, labels mean what you would expect, it stitches together nicely, there is a great amount of control over the elements so you can create a nice product.  Truthfully, it all makes sense other than how to place items at specific locations on the display screen - how to control the real estate.

2)  It is very easy to read and write.  I know that we can add functionality with java, however, I guess I wish there were a more direct method - this may be a result of being new to programming.

3)  I am fine on the HTML, other than there is quite a bit to ultimately know.  I am referring to my studies prior to phase_0 that revealed the nubmer of special words to know.  This is very cool, just a case of use an d memorization.  I was finding some difficulties with the use of Git/GitHub and pushing my work, until I thought of using the open command and I was able to see a path to accomplish my work.

4) I have been using w3schools and found it to be quite cool.

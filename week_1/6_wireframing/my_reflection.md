## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

1) What did you learn about design and user experience? 
2) Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

3) What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
4) What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
5) Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
6) How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
7) Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
8) Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

1)  How important it is to think through, consider, get direct feedin/feedback from users, when designing a site or app.  

2)  I really like design and am looking forward to creating really cool sites/Apps that help people use computers even better.  (I would have had more satisfication if I could have sized my images.  I took screenshoots and then converted them to JPEGs.  I then applied height/width CSS with no success.  I am wondering if the files were truly changed to JPEGs and if this matters.  Please what am I overlooking?)

3)  I had studied UI and design 2 years ago over the summer solo.  I find the entire field fascinating.  I really liked using Wirify by Volkside - very cool.  

4)  The ideas seem accessible to me.  I would like more "control" over my HTML elements so I can tinker more with the design side of the page.

5)  I really liked using Wirify by Volkside.

6)  I feel like I am hovering around 85% confident, even though my html doesn't show the design I would like to produce.

7)  I enjoyed building another site, looking for webpages that struck a cord for me and WireFraming them.  I look forward to wireframing more sites to see what else I can learn.

8)  Not too much that was tedious.  I enjoyed reading the articles and using Wirify.

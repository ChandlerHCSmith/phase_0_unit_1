Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I enjoyed reviewing sites that I commonly use and seeing them with these eyes.  It was interesting to think about what makes a website uesful, interesting, and engaging.  I did find it useful and will look at other sites through these eyes and with the wireframing in mind as well.  It was not cumbersome, however I would like to make improvements on my Blog Site.  It would like to add other content, automated dates when blogs are added, create a background div that expanded with the text or use a text-area.  I would also like to allow others to comment on my blog.

## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

1)  a)  What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? 
    b)  What did you learn in the process?
2) Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
3) Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
4) Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
5) What doesn't make sense? What does?


1)  
      a)  It didn't seem that difficult, it was mostly the unknown.  Having never used Git or GitHub, not 
          being sure that I had installed everything correctly, not having a project to work on with others to           see it in dynamic flow to provide a sense of proof.  I worked on this quite a while back when 
          reading through a portion of the Michael Hartl book.
      b)  It would have been a good idea to have reached out to someone to work with them directly.  This   
          would have provided the confidence as well as more familiarity.
      
2)  Git:  Imagine that you plan on writing a story or designing something.  As you create, you make changes as           we all do.  It would be very nice to have the option of revisiting any version of your story or 
          creation as it was at any given time in the past.  This would allow you to go back and recover an 
          idea that you discarded or make other changes.  Now, let's expand this to include a team of writers 
          or inventors.  It would be nice to all be able to work, create changes, and still have the option of
          "back-tracking", and be able to identify who did what.  These are all options necessary for 
          successful collaboration.

    GitHub: Imagine you wanted to place all of your work-in-progress on the Internet and share it with a 
            limited number of collaborators or with everyone to leverage collective creativity, while still 
            using the abilities of Git.

3)	Version control allows the revisiting of any work at a given developmental point in its past.  It also 
    allows collaborators to work 	freely knowing that changes can be undone and the author of portions of code     can be identified to help in communication.

    I thought that Git was the version control component and GitHub was the inter-connectiveness.  Not sure 
    how GitHub helps in version control.

4)	Developers use version control to allow people to work collaboratively, to revisit work, to have 
    co-existing versions of the same work-in-progress, to keep track of many of the important aspects of 
    working collaboratively without bogging down creativity.  I know that Git, versus other methods of version     control, keep not only changes, but the entire copy of the working file - this is faster to work with.  
    This seems to make sense to me.  I believe that after using it I will see much more than I have written 
    here.

5)	Its basic advantages seem to make sense.  Really, for me it is simply using Git, gaining familiarity, 
    seeing where I have questions, and better seeing its  more advance advantages.

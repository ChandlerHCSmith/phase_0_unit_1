## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

1) What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
2) What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
3) How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
4) Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
5) Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1) I learned that the web and the internet are not the same.  It makes total sense, but I had never thought it all the way out.  I also learned what DNS is and why it is needed.  I liked the clear connection to a phone directory.  Still am curious about the lag time when changing domain names.  I know that there needs to be some, but why, what appears to be so much?

2) Clearly know the purposes of the HTML site.  What are the goals of the customer/clients?  How is the site to be utilized, what are its main functions?  Follow all proper coding protocols.

3)  It was very cool!  I have ChandlerHCSmith as my repository name.  Is it Case Sensitive?  I have looked this up on the internet and have not found anything conclusive.  Thanks!

4)  I really liked having a better understanding of the Web, Web Browser, Servicers, etc than I thought I already had.  I enjoy working with GitHub and think that it is a very useful and well laid out platform.

5)  I found the number of webpages to read sufficient.  Didn't need to turn to the web for anything, other than to try to verify Cap-Sensitivity of GitHub repository names.

Thanks!

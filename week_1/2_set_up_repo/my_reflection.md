1)	Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person

I am assuming that I have explained to our non-technical person the details of Git and GitHub and that they have downloaded Git, the GitHub App and have a GitHub Account.

You want to work on a project with some friends.  You are the originator of this particular endeavor.  You want to place this information on GitHub so it can be shared, modified, and tracked.  This is done by creating what is called a repository.  In this situation, repository means exactly that, a container, a place to store something.  You are going to store your work and then allow others to work on it with you - how fun! :)

Open GitHub on your computer and login.  Once logged in, you need to click on the little plus symbol next to your screen name in the upper right-hand corner.  After clicking on this little plus symbol, you will have 2 choices, pick new repository.  

Now it is important to name your repository with a meaningful name.

Decide if you are planning a Private or Public endeavor at the moment.

Next, decide on your licensing. (You may want to read up on the several different types of licenses.)

Finally, click Create Repository.

There you go!  You have a repository.

However, your repository is only that, a container.

Now to add files and start working you need to Clone your Repository.

To Clone a Repository you need to open your GitHub App on your computer and click the Clone to Computer button next to the desired repository.

You will be asked where on your computer you will want the repository to be placed.

You are now done!

2)	Describe what open source means

Open source is any programming code that can be viewed, copied, modified, improved upon, and redistributed.  The goal being to confer mutual benefit.

3)	What do you think about Open Source?  Does it make you nervous or protective?  Does it feel like utopia?

It does not make me nervous or protective.  I see its benefits.  It is not always important to be the only vendor in town, just as long as you provide 5 to 10% better service or quality.  I see this as a way to keep the ball rolling to further innovation and benefit in turn from innovation.  Now, if a team and I spent the amount of time that some people have spent on, for example PhotoShop, maybe my opinion would change.  

4)	assess the importance of using licenses

It seems wise to license any materials that you have produced.  One's own work is worthy of being related back to the author.  Sharing and working with others has its potential benefits, however, creating open source without a license is the same as giving away all of your rights.  After looking at the MIT license, it would appear that licensing also protects the author from ill affect that the open source may cause in a modified or supplemented program.

5)	What concepts were solidified in the challenge?  Did you have any "aha" moments?  What did you struggle with?

I liked the idea of creating something and placing it on GitHub.  This was exciting!  I liked the idea that I would be creating something with others and building a project.  Git/GitHub is something I wish we had in more of life.  There have been so many times while working that I wanted to go back to a version of a document or a project and either resume or review and move forward.  Occasionally, I have kept very accurate records and have been able to do this all the time wishing I was always afforded such luxury - well now it's here!  I tried to use the Command Line and was unsuccessful.  It mentioned that some fatal error occurred.  I followed the instructions to what seemed like a tie, used what appeared to be the correct path, but maybe next time.

6)	Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand the topic?  If so, please list it.

I watched a couple of youtube videos from GitHub Social Coding.  They were useful and I will probably watch a few more in the near future.
